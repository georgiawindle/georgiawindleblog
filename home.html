    <p>Hiya,</p>
  <p>My name is Georgia, and welcome to my blog. I am currently a student at Victoria University of Wellington studying interaction design. </p>
  <p>Besides studying all the time, I do have aspects of my life I enjoy in my free time. One of my favourites activities is reading, especially during the summertime. I also enjoy cooking, not to fuss on what, though do enjoy the sweet side of food a bit more. </p>
