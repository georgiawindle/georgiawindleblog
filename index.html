<h3>Tuesday 21st July – Blog Draft</h3>	
<p>Today was about researching different blog designs that inspired us. For me, I choose to go for the simple root, as I knew if I made it to complex now, it might not work in the long-run. The requirements made for the blog are that there will be at least two pages, a home page, and a reflection page....   </p>

The requirements made for the blog are that there will be at least two pages, a home page, and a reflection page.   </p>
      <p>The home page is where I introduce myself and what I'm studying etc. The layout of the page has been set out that there would be an image at the top of the page, and text at the bottom, which I will set out using columns. The reflection page is where each week, the documentation of my own progress will be recorded.  The layout of this page is similar to the home page in away. Depending on what type of post will be posted, it could change the number of images used, and then the text would appear underneath the images. The Nav is on the right-hand side of the page, though this page has also got the element where the user will choose a specific blog post, so they won't have to scroll through each one.</p>

<h3>Thursday 23rd July – CSS</h3>
    		 <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on a screen, paper, or other media. It is one of the main aspects used when designing websites.  We learned about today was the positions property as a lot in the class have found it challenging to use. Positions property is often used as a way to place some aspects of a page into specific areas. This aspect will help out a lot in different web layouts. It can also be used as a way to help overlap specific tools. </p>

      <p>I then went and had a play around with it in w3schools. Playing around with the static, relative, absolute, and fixed positions ic the CSS. What I did like about these different positions is the relative/ about the cause. When using these elements together, you can get a nice overlap effect, which I could use on the home page of the blog. Though I know if I were to use this in my code, I will find it hard to figure out.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 28th - Thursday 30th July – Flexbox + Responsive</h3>
 <p>Today's task was to copy code from GitHub and using flexbox to make the Website responsive. This is to make sure no matter what screen the Website gets used on, the information will change its layout accordingly. I found this quite tricky as I used an aspect of code I didn't know of before.  </p>
