  <p>Today was about researching different blog designs that inspired us. For me, I choose to go for the simple root, as I knew if I made it to complex now, it might not work in the long-run. The requirements made for the blog are that there will be at least two pages, a home page, and a reflection page.   </p>
      <p>The home page is where I introduce myself and what I'm studying etc. The layout of the page has been set out that there would be an image at the top of the page, and text at the bottom, which I will set out using columns. The reflection page is where each week, the documentation of my own progress will be recorded.  The layout of this page is similar to the home page in away. Depending on what type of post will be posted, it could change the number of images used, and then the text would appear underneath the images. The Nav is on the right-hand side of the page, though this page has also got the element where the user will choose a specific blog post, so they won't have to scroll through each one.</p>

<h3>Thursday 23rd July – CSS</h3>
    		 <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on a screen, paper, or other media. It is one of the main aspects used when designing websites.  We learned about today was the positions property as a lot in the class have found it challenging to use. Positions property is often used as a way to place some aspects of a page into specific areas. This aspect will help out a lot in different web layouts. It can also be used as a way to help overlap specific tools. </p>

      <p>I then went and had a play around with it in w3schools. Playing around with the static, relative, absolute, and fixed positions ic the CSS. What I did like about these different positions is the relative/ about the cause. When using these elements together, you can get a nice overlap effect, which I could use on the home page of the blog. Though I know if I were to use this in my code, I will find it hard to figure out.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 28th - Thursday 30th July – Flexbox + Responsive</h3>
 <p>Today's task was to copy code from GitHub and using flexbox to make the Website responsive. This is to make sure no matter what screen the Website gets used on, the information will change its layout accordingly.

What I did find challenging was getting the coloums to work how I wanted them to. This is because I was trying to figure out how I would put a column within a column.

Having taken the break, I was able to see it all with fresh eyes and get it all working again as I wanted it to.</p>

  <p>For today's task, it was going over the brief for project one and starting to look between the two options available to choose from.</p>
      <p>The Website I have decided to recreate is the travel website. As I find, especially with covers currently happening globally, it would be good to have a travel website where the COVID-19 information was accessible.  I then spent the rest of the lesson looking up examples of the travel website to help give me inspiration for my redesign. I then started to develop different ideas I could do in Figma. I came up with a possible layout of the Website.</p>

      <p>The reason I found it hard was because I had to recreate it off an image we had been given to create it. Though at the end of the task, I was able to make the gird to be responsive. The way I made sure I had it that it was responsive was by changing the colour of the text, so when the screen size got smaller, it helps indicate the smaller screen size.</p>

 <p> I have started to play around with the font choices and colour theme. Trying to find two fonts which work well together is hard. What I had in mind was for the heading I wanted to have a font which was curvy and loopy, as I find for a blog it helps gives that personal touch to it. The heading font I choose to go with is 'Dancing Script', and for the body text, I choose 'Sarabun'.   What I like about these two fonts is that they are both so different from each other, but they work well together.</p>  
 <p>When it comes to the colour theme, I don't know why but I love the colour baby blue, so I choose to use this as one of my primary colours for the Website. Another colour I found worked well was baby pink, as I found it was a nice soft colour which went with the blue colour.</p>

 <p>Over the break, we had to come up with an idea for a website which we would then pitch to our group. The idea I came up with was one based on UX design – where it would go into explaining what it was, the different aspects of it, etc.  </p>
      <p>Though as a group, we went with the idea of indoor plants. What I like about this is it's different from another website out there, which is what makes it stand out. So for the group, I made a miro board (online whiteboard), from there we started to play around with different colour themes, layouts, what we wanted from the Website. With the miro board, we came up with four main things we needed to get done before we started wireframes. These four aspects were – user stories, uses, ideas, pages, and the mood board.  We then move this information into Figma, so all the information was in the same space.</p>

 <p> At first, I didn't understand what I was supposed to as my user- flow, as there was no real definition. Though being in a group helped with this aspect, some of them knew which helped us al get started, what we did as a group was come up with two user stories each.  The user stories I focused on were a young family who wanted to have something fun and easy to do with their children and also one where it was a university student wanted to have an easy plant to be able to look over.  What made these aspects take awhile was making sure as a group we weren't doubling up on any f the users. We then moved on and, as a group, came up with the user flow for the users in general for the two pages of the Website.</p>

 <p>Over these next few days, it is about getting the layout sorted. What we wanted from the Website is that it is easy for the user to navigate between the different pages. The block frames are the most basic of wireframes, whereas the designer I was getting an idea of where. As a group, we designed three pages each and then pulled apart different ideas we liked from each to help build our final idea.</p>  
 <p>With the final block frames being decided, we then moved on to the wireframes fo the Website. With the wireframes, they don't include the colour or images. Still, they do include the different headings, placeholders for the text and images. To make this Website not have too many pages, we have created a pop-up page (modal) for the plant index. The only difficulty with this idea is getting the pop-up to work how we want it to. </p>

 <p>After having done the wireframes for the group project, one of the aspects I liked was the pop-up page, and I thought I might change up my design and see how it would work for my blog. The reason I Choose to change my initial idea is that I wonder if the user would want to have to scroll through all the blog pages, as it would be much information on one page. If I choose to do as a pop-up instead, I could have images as the button then once clicked to pop-up with the information on the post.</p>  
 <p>What I found when using w3schools is for a pop-up to work it contains javascript, and it called a 'modal' instead. So using w3schools schools, I was able to get the pop-up working. Though it took some difficulty to figure out how to make the image a button, I was able to complete the task.  Though before I got the layout sorted, I wanted to make sure I could get two modals working on the same page. When I first tried this, I couldn't get it to work. I tried doubling the java, but this didn't work. The next step I took was researching how to have multiple modals on one page, but still, it wouldn't work. As its getting late I have decided to stop for now and come back tomorrow and see if I can get it working with fresh eyes.</p>

 <p>After having difficulty yesterday, I decided to research how to fix the problem I had again. As I am now more awake, I am was able to figure out how to have more than one modal on a single webpage. The reason it wasn't working was that I had to change an aspect of the code where it talked about the modals and add a number at the end to show its another one being added.</p>  
 <p>Now that I have this aspect of the blog working, I have chosen to move away from the use of columns and use grids. The reason I have chosen to do this is that when it comes to making it responsive, having, grids will work better than using the columns. The way I have chosen to lay out the grid is by threes, as it fits nicely across the page without it looking too crowded.</p>

 <p>Before we started to create the prototype of the Website, we split into two groups; one was working on the font choices and the other colour theme.  For the colour theme, we already knew we wanted to use greens, as this is a plant-based website. Another colour we want to use was orange, as it helps gives a sort of brightness to its webpage. Though, this part was quite difficult to sort. The reason it was hard was that we were trying to find the right shades of green and orange to use; we wanted to make sure they would complement each other.  What helped was using adobe colour wheel, as we were able to upload an over image of the colour we liked and choose the best colour to use.</p>  
 <p>We then moved on to creating a page each for the prototyping. The page I choose was the landing page. For this page, it was about finding a background image that then matched the theme of our Website. For the buttons for this page, I choose to go with a bright orange as it standouts nicely against the green background. What was hard at first was figuring out to do the overlay to show that the page was a pop-up. Still, after playing around with the different settings, I was able to figure it out.</p>

 <p>Today we again split into two groups, one finishing off the prototype for presentation, and the other sorting out the testing questions. For the prototype, it was almost done; we were making sure our Figma work was cleaned up in general and making sure that all aspect of our prototype was working as expected.</p>  
 <p>The Feedback we were given was quite good, with only a few changes having to be made to the prototype. The central aspect we had t fixe were – The logo size, landing page layout, drop showdown and the background colour of the images – making sure they are all the same.  As I made the landing page in the first page, I then came up with two different versions we could then base it off, and as a group, we then choose which one we liked the best. What I did was right again the information on the landing page rather than centre it. Then with the logo as a group, we decided to change the 'G' for greenhouse with the logo, which adds in an extra feature to the webpage.</p>

 <p>Even though I like the new layout of the blog, I don't know if it's the best way I can show my work. Before I started with the layout, I thought I might change the colour choices I have chosen. Though I like the colour I chose, I do wonder if they might be a bit on the young side instead of the more adult. So what I di this time was go onto adobe colour wheel. What I knew was I want to have a bit of a blue/ green theme. I don't know why I choose these colours. I think they will look excellent and fresh on the page. Another colour I liked was peachy; the only thing is I don't know if I will join us.</p>  
 <p>This new layout goes back to the original idea in a way. I have side navbar on the left side, which takes up the whole page. I then have chosen to break up the rest of the page into sections per blog, to help separate the information on the page. For the navbar, I'm thinking of doing a dark blue to make it stand out against a white background, while I have the sections as filled in blue-green.</p>

 <p>With having changed my idea again, I have now put it into code. What I like about this design is it looks a lot more professional. The easy part of the code was organizing the sidebar, but the hard part was getting the sections to work. The reason I had trouble getting the section part to work was that I was trying to get a section within a section. The way I got it to work in the end, was by adding a class into the section called 'post', as it is where the blog post will be happening.</p>  
 <p>To had a more exciting aspect to the Website, I have added in an automatic slideshow of images for the different post.  I was thinking of making it that you press a button and change between the images that way. Still, I found with it being automatic it is a more modern Website, where it can do it. Like when doing the modal, I could not get it to work for more than one per page. So I fixed it by looking it up, and that part I had to change was making sure the javascript was for all slides, not just one. .</p>

 <p>After receiving the Feedback on having to make the mobile prototype, we started to create this stage in Figma. This stage was relatively easy for us all to complete as a group, cause we were reformatting the desktop pages, so when on a smaller screen it would stack on top of each other instead.</p>  
 <p>With having completed this stage of the code, I then created a GitHub for us all to use, so that by the next session, we would be able to get the code started. Another aspect we got started for the Website is just created a raw file format which we uploaded to the master, so we each had the same format.</p>

 <p>For creating the Website, my group decided it was best to divide into two groups. One group will do the code side, and the other group was in charge of organizing the images and the information at different times. For me, I was helping with the code side. The page i am Coding is the PLANT INDEX; this is because this page contains a lot of pop-up pages (modal), and I already know how to create multiple of these on a page.</p>  
 <p>What I found hard with creating the multiple pop-up pages, was putting them within a gird. At first, it took some fiddling around to get them functioning probably but after a few tries were able to get the modal working inside of the gird.</p>

Instead of focusing on all the different pages, I focused on getting the first one working how we all intended. It took a while to figure out the best way to layout each area. For creating the split, where I have the image is on the left and the image on the right, I created a class to make sure the text would float on the left-hand side.</p>  
 <p>With having this aspect done, I was playing around with the layout to find the best way to make it fit the prototype I made.</p>

 <p>Today I was adding the final touches to my blog layout. I kept the layout of what I had. However, I changed a few aspects of it to make it a bit more advance I took out the aspects where the images were part of a slideshow as I couldn't get it to work how I needed it to. So instead, I made a modal for each of the different blog posts. With adding this feature it helps keep the layout nice and clean, and it also helps with making sure the images are bigger are easier to see. </p>  
 <p>What I did next tried and make the Website responsive. This part took quite a while to try and figure out. The first part I focused on was getting the navbar working. What I wanted was for the navbar to go from the side to the top when the screen gets smaller. I was able to get it working with the help of W3schools. The next part was trying to get the body of the page to change its layout when the navbar went to the top of the page. The way I was able to fix this aspect was taking it out of a section and putting it in a div content. With this, I was able to make the Website responsive.</p>

 <p>Today I was continuing making my blog responsive, but instead focusing on getting the images on the modal to be responsive. The best way I found to make it responsive was by putting the images into a gird, so when the page changes size, the pictures then stack on top of each other.</p>  
 <p>With having used the girds on the modal for the blog, I then used this code to help make my page for the group project responsive. So as the screen changes size, the elements on the page then change the layout. Another aspect I was to do for this Website was put all the information onto the different models, so now the page is almost done. The next step is to make the navbar at the top responsive, which I will be doing on Saturday. When this element is done, the Website will be all finished. YAY!</p>
